BLOCK 1
for radix between 0 - 16:
    create mask corresponding to radix
    exclusive scan on the mask of this radix
    get the sum of occurencies of the current radix
exclusive scan on the mask of all radix
createte histogram with the sum of occurencies of radixes
compute new indices (not final) based on the values of the mask scan + histogram

on global level:
    scan-block-sum = exclusive scan on block_su array from BLOCK 1(arrays corresponding to frequency of each radix in each block)

BLOCK 2
 Shuffle input data based on the following index:
 prefix-sum[id] (scan on the scan of mask) + scan-block-sum[id]
